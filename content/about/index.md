Hi, I am a site reliability engineer and system developer with specialization in networks and communication systems.
Graduated with a MSc in Computer Science - Networks and Distributed Systems from Chalmers University of Technology in 2013.
I enjoy studying, building and developing network systems using Linux, C, Golang, and other open source solutions. You can find more information about me in my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HOWM9vcwScF6BEWcyVe9Dp5uQLK8VJUp/view) and other social links on the right.
