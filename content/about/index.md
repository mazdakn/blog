Hi, I am a site reliability engineer and system developer with specialization in networks and communication systems.
Graduated with a MSc in Computer Science - Networks and Distributed Systems from Chalmers University of Technology in 2013.
I enjoy studying, building and developing network systems using Linux, C, Golang, Rust and other open source solutions, and I have been doing it over 10 years.
